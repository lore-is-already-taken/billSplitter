# How to run
This is meant to me a full app so all you need is in this repo

## To run the Front
cd into the client folder and run the following commands
` npm install `
and to run the front in dev mode run: 
`npm run dev`
this is using vite and react
## Backend
To install dependencies
`go mod tidy`
to run the back
`go run main.go`
## Database
`cd database`
the run the docker-compose file
`docker-compose up`


Doing that you should be all set up
```
